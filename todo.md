# TODO List for "GPUs for Efficient ROMs of Geometric Nonlinear Structural Optimization"


- [ ] demo Qjan's online trust region with RB error bounds method on a beam / plate optimization problem (for structures)
- [ ] investigate beam POD case with high stresses, see if numerical issues in SVD. Consider mean, normalize disps before building RB, then check 1st and 2nd derivs
- [ ] demo an aeroelastic ROM with Arrow, MELD, TACS GPU
- [ ] compare hyper reduction with GPU assembly of reduced stiffness matrix (for geom nonlinear plate)
