# Trust Regions

* general literature on trust regions with constrained optimizatoin

* SNOPT seems to sue QP updates not trust region, see how does major and minor iterations and whether we can use PROM with it, or need to write our own code
* it seems that trust region can use inequality constraints using an SQP strategy (so maybe this does work)
